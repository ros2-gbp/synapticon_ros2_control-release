Introduction
===============

This repository provides an example of using Synapticon drives (SOMANET Node, SOMANET Circulo and SOMANET Integro) in CSP, CSV, and CST modes using the ROS2 package. It utilizes SOEM Ethercat Master. ROS2 package was originally developed by Andy Zelenak. Synapticon GmbH adds examples, simulation and adds the extended instructions for easier installation as well as support for containerization using Docker.

Intention
---------

The intention of this documentation is to provide instructions on how to quickly start using Synapticon Devices with ROS2 using Synapticon library.

Additionally, in order to make it compatible with other Linux distributions, we provide Docker file and script for automatic interface recognition and quick set-up of the package inside the container.
