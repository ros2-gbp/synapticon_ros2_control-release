In the figure below, a block diagram of the wiring used in this setup is given. The provided package assumes that the laptop on which the setup is used has only one Ethernet port. Hardware can be used once the parameters are configured with `OBLAC tools <https://www.synapticon.com/en/products/oblac-drives>`__. Detailed instructions and wiring diagrams for all the devices are available at our `official web page <https://www.synapticon.com/en/support/dokumentation>`__  documentation. Software allows daisy chaining of all the Synapticon drives in any order.
