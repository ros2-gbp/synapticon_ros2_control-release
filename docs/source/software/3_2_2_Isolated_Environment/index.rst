Isolated Environment (Docker)
======================================

      For users with different Linux distributions or those preferring
      isolated environment, Docker can be used. Installation steps can be found in
      the `Docker
      Documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>`__.
      For the completeness of the documentation, we provide those steps
      in the following subsection.
